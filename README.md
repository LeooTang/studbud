# My Web-design
The documentation will introduce the key information about the web prototype and how the iteration proceeded from mock-ups to the prototype. 

The web prototype studbud designed for international student English learning contains two pages home and dictionary (including a pop-up timer tab). The main purpose of web app is to help international students manage their tasks, focus on academic work and develop extensive English skills, so as to promote better study experience.

# Mock-ups
![previous work example](/pre-work/home1.jpg)

In the design proposal stage, mock-ups mainly includes five pages. I tried to include "get involved" section to meet the needs of more users, but this deviated from the essence of the webpage for initial target users.

*You can check all the mock-ups in **pre-work** folder.


# Changes & iteration
## Main iteration
1. To make the function of the prototype web page more prominent and target the crowd, I **removed the get involved **part (the original get involved part introduced different ways to participate in organizing activities, such as volunteers, parades, etc.), and only kept it The function of **donate** is also in line with my positioning of autism spectrum Australia in the previous assessment-a non-profit fundraising website.
2. For donations, the three-step separate form would be cumbersome and challenging to check information, so I made the paginated donation into **one single page of donation** so that users can check whether the information they have filled in is correct at any time.
> The less action is required from users to test a service, the more likely a random visitor is to actually try it out -- Friedman

## Layout iteration
1. I modified the frame structure of the news section, which changed from a regular square matrix to **two containers**. The use of containers is conducive to information classification.(Network for good, 2021)

![This picture shows how news works, the containers will categorize news so that users can browse better](/prototype/news2.png)

2. In order to ensure that users can help effectively without being confused, I removed the pop-up window of the online question and answer and only **kept the Inquiry interface**.

![Inquiry form will allows users ask questions to the charity anytime they want](/prototype/inquiry.png)

## Feedback
1. According to the feedback from the tutor and peers, I modified the overall structure so that the ideal web prototype was not achievable for me.
2. Tutor's feedback mentioned that the **colour contrast** between the current navbar and the background is not apparent enough, so I added more colour contrast to some sections to make the critical information more prominent.

![This is a example image that I improve the color contrast to outstand the key information](/prototype/donate1.png)

## Challenges
Due to the lack of knowledge of web design concepts and the shortfall of JavaScript skills, I had to make concessions in the design of some places. For example, the search function on the news interface does not work, and the contact information displayed on the about interface is slightly rigid.

# Web prototype



As I said at the beginning, the primary purpose of the webpage is to give users the confidence to trust our charity to complete donations. The **Inquiry button** provided allows customers to ask the agency to solve their problems at any time, and users can contact the agency effectively and quickly without cumbersome operations. The **news** section allows customers to understand what the organization has done before and enhance credibility; the **comment box** at the bottom enables customers to comment on our activities at any time to increase interactivity. The combination of **video embedding** and character **pictures** can also increase realism and empathy.（Fritz，2019）

# Reflection
## What did well?
The ideation and iteration phase showed an adequate concept exploration with multiple design principles and justifications. The overall prototype shows clear structure and hierarchy and looks neat with layout and clear explanations.
## What didn't go well?
Other than the technical reasons mentioned in the challenges, I did not do enough in the theoretical support of the initial iteration. In the case of insufficient layout when coding the web page, I will adjust it according to subjective wishes, so some CSS is not perfected very well.
# For Future
In the next step of improving the web page prototype, it is necessary to refine the CSS again. Although there is a certain degree of flexibility in the specific size of mobile, the current Mediainquiry cannot adapt to other dimensions of screens. At the same time, the use of JS technology to develop more functions while maintaining a stable and efficient browsing environment and user communication is critical for future web development.
