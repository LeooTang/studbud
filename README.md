# My Web-design
The documentation will introduce the key information about the web prototype and how the iteration proceeded from mock-ups to the prototype. 

The web prototype studbud designed for international student English learning contains two pages home and dictionary (including a pop-up timer tab). The main purpose of web app is to help international students manage their tasks, focus on academic work and develop extensive English skills, so as to promote better study experience.

# Project Specifications
1. KanbanBoard
2. Tasklist block
3. Pop-up Tab
4. Stopwatch
5. Pomodoro Timer
6. Music player with embeded music list
7. Dictionary Look-up

# Mock-ups
![previous work example](/public/prototype/mock_up.jpg)

In the design proposal stage, mock-ups mainly includes two pages. I tried to include "vocab list" section to meet the needs of more users, but this deviated from the essence of the webpage for initial target users.

*more prework in **prototype** folder.


# Changes & iteration
## Main iteration
To make the function of the prototype web page more understandble, I **moved the music player** to the footer from the tab, and only kept the two kinds of timer in the pop-up section.

## Layout iteration
1. For dictionary, I discard the vocab list to keep the dictionary interface simple and clear.

## Feedback
1. According to the feedback from the tutor and peers, I modified the overall structure so that the web prototype is more achievable for me.
2. Tutor's feedback mentioned that the **consistency** of color in my mock-up, so I removed some unneccessary color of my design.

## Challenges
Due to the lack of knowledge of web design concepts and the shortfall of JavaScript skills, I had to make concessions in the design of some places. For example, the drag&drop function in the Kanbanboard has bugs, and the responsive screen is slightly rigid.

# Reflection
## What did well?
The ideation and iteration phase showed an adequate concept exploration with multiple design principles and justifications. The overall prototype shows clear structure and hierarchy and looks neat with layout and clear explanations.
## What didn't go well?
Other than the technical reasons mentioned in the challenges, I did not do enough in the theoretical support of the initial iteration. In the case of insufficient layout when coding the web page, I will adjust it according to subjective wishes, so some CSS is not perfected very well.
# For Future
In the next step of improving the web page prototype, it is necessary to refine the CSS again. Although there is a certain degree of flexibility in the specific size of mobile, the current Mediainquiry cannot adapt to other dimensions of screens. Meanwhile, the use of JS technology to refine and develop more functions while maintaining a stable and efficient browsing environment and user communication is critical for future web development.
